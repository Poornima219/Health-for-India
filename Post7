<p>Making changes to your diet and workout routine can help reduce water weight and prevent fluid build-up. Certain supplements may also be beneficial.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The human body contains around 60% water, which plays a key role in all aspects of life (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK541059/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1Trusted Source</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still, many people worry about water weight. This especially applies to professional athletes and bodybuilders who wish to meet a weight category or improve their appearance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Excess water retention, also known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/edema">edema</a>, is a different issue. Though it’s usually harmless, it may be a side effect of serious medical conditions, such as heart, liver, or kidney disease (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072593/" target="_blank">2Trusted Source</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People may also experience water retention during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle and during pregnancy (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7429427/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/swollen-ankles-feet-and-fingers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4</a>).</p>

<p>This article is for healthy people and athletes who wish to reduce their water weight. If you have a serious edema — swelling of your feet or arms — consult a doctor to determine the cause and best course of treatment.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/does-exercise-cause-weight-loss">Exercise</a>&nbsp;may be one of the best ways to reduce water weight in the short-term. Any form of exercise increases sweat, which means you will lose water.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not uncommon to lose a small amount of body weight from sweating during exercise, depending on factors such as heat and clothing (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6773238/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5Trusted Source</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During exercise, your body also shifts a lot of water into your muscles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This can help reduce water outside of the cell and decrease the “soft” look people report from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/6-ways-to-reduce-water-retention">excessive water retention</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723611/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">6Trusted Source</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, you still need to drink plenty of water during your training session.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another good option to increase sweat and water loss is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/are-saunas-good-for-you">sauna</a>, which you could add in after your gym session.</p>

<h2><a></a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>2. Increase potassium consumption</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-does-potassium-do">Potassium</a>&nbsp;is an important electrolyte involved in regulating fluid balance (<a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7Trusted Source</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It helps counteract the effects of sodium by increasing urine production, which could prevent water retention and fluid build-up (<a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/potassium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8Trusted Source</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Increasing your intake of potassium may be beneficial for reducing excess water weight, especially if you aren’t regularly eating&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/high-potassium-foods">potassium-rich foods</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many fruits and vegetables are high in potassium, including potatoes, apricots, spinach, and tomatoes (<a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7Trusted Source</a>).</p>

<h2><a></a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>3. Manage salt intake</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-sodium-per-day">Sodium</a>, which you obtain daily from salt, is one of the most common electrolytes in the human body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It plays a major role in hydration levels. If sodium levels are too low or too high, it will lead to imbalances within the body and, therefore, fluid retention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A high&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/salt-good-or-bad">salt intake</a>, usually due to a diet with lots of processed foods, may increase water retention (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28253022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28414294/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34798374/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">11Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28414302/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12Trusted Source</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, this seems to depend on the individual’s current daily sodium intake and blood levels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, some research suggests that a sudden increase in sodium consumption may lead to increased thirst and fluid intake, which could result in fluid retention (<a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/463831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">13</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><a></a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>4. Take a magnesium supplement</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magnesium is another key electrolyte and mineral. It has recently become a very popular supplement for health and sports performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Research regarding&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-does-magnesium-do">magnesium</a>&nbsp;has been extensive and shows that it has over 600 roles within the human body (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25540137" target="_blank">14Trusted Source</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some studies also suggest that magnesium can ease symptoms of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/premenstrual-syndrome">premenstrual syndrome</a>&nbsp;(PMS), including water retention (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28392498/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">15Trusted Source</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These changes occur because magnesium plays an integrative role with other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/electrolytes">electrolytes</a>, such as sodium and potassium. Together, they help control your body’s water balance (<a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">16Trusted Source</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Magnesium supplements have numerous other potential health benefits for people who are lacking it in their diet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to magnesium supplements,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-foods-high-in-magnesium">magnesium-rich foods</a>&nbsp;are also recommended. These include dark green leafy vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains (<a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">16Trusted Source</a>).</p>

<h2><a></a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>5. Take a dandelion supplement</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dandelion, also known as&nbsp;<em>Taraxacum officinale</em>, is an herb used in alternative medicine to treat water retention (<a href="https://bnrc.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s42269-021-00567-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">17</a>).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In recent years, it has also become popular among bodybuilders and athletes who need to drop water for aesthetic purposes or to meet a weight category (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8201693/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">18Trusted Source</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/dandelion-benefits">Dandelion supplements</a>&nbsp;may help you lose water weight by signaling the kidneys to expel more urine and additional salt or sodium.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is supported by some older studies, which show that taking dandelion supplements increases the frequency of urination over a 5-hour period (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19678785" target="_blank">19Trusted Source</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><a></a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>7. Cut carbs</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cutting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/good-carbs-bad-carbs">carbs</a>&nbsp;is a common strategy to quickly drop excess water. Carbs are stored in the muscles and liver as glycogen, but glycogen also pulls water inside along with it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For every gram of glycogen you store, 3–4 grams (0.11–0.14 ounces) of water may be stored with it. This explains why people experience immediate weight loss when switching to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/low-carb-diet-meal-plan-and-menu">low carb diet</a>, which reduces glycogen stores (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25911631/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">26Trusted Source</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Carbs also lead to a rise in the hormone insulin, which can increase sodium retention and reabsorption of water in the kidneys (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2020.00519/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">27</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><a></a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>8. Take caffeine supplements or drink tea and coffee</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Caffeine and beverages that contain caffeine, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/top-evidence-based-health-benefits-of-coffee">coffee</a>&nbsp;and tea, have diuretic effects and may help reduce water weight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It has been shown to increase short-term urine output and decrease water weight slightly (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5563313/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">28Trusted Source</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://medlineplus.gov/caffeine.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">29</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This may vary depending on the amount of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-is-caffeine">caffeine</a>&nbsp;that is consumed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, one small study found that drinking about 537 milligrams (mg) of caffeine, or approximately 6 cups of coffee, significantly increased urine production. On the other hand, drinking 269 mg of caffeine, or around 3 cups of coffee, had no effect on fluid balance (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5563313/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">28Trusted Source</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, even though caffeine may have a mild diuretic effect, other research suggests that it doesn’t lead to dehydration in habitual consumers (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24416202/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30Trusted Source</a>).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2><a>The bottom line</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your water retention problem persists, seems severe, or increases suddenly, it’s always best to seek medical attention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In some cases, excess water retention can be caused by a serious medical condition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the end of the day, the best way to combat excess water weight is to identify and treat the cause.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This may include excess salt intake, lack of electrolytes, inactivity, excess stress, or the regular consumption of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/junk-food-vs-healthy-food">processed foods</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of these are also among the main causes linked to poor health and disease, which may be even bigger reasons to avoid them.</p>
