<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A diabetes drug has received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to also be used as a weight-loss medication in patients with obesity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The medication, Wegovy, is a higher dose of the diabetes drug semaglutide produced by Novo Nordisk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s the first drug for chronic weight management that has been approved by the FDA since 2014.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wegovy, administered via a once-weekly injection, is indicated for people with a body mass index (BMI) of 27 kg/m2 or higher and who have at least one weight-related medical condition such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. The medication is also for people who have a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or higher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the United States, approximately 1 in 3 adults — over 100 million people — have obesity. Treating obesity can improve blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Today’s approval offers adults with obesity or overweight a beneficial new treatment option to incorporate into a weight management program,” Dr. John Sharretts, the deputy director of the Division of Diabetes, Lipid Disorders, and Obesity in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-drug-treatment-chronic-weight-management-first-2014" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a statementTrusted Source</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a><strong>What to know about Wegovy</strong></a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wegovy is a synthetic version of a hormone in the gut, glucagon-like peptide-1, that affects the parts of the brain that control hunger and appetite.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is injected under the skin once a week.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It slows emptying of the stomach. It promotes the feeling of fullness (satiety) by acting on the brain, particularly at the level of the hypothalamus,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ethosendo.com/about-aleem-kanji-md/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Aleem Kanji</a>, a board-certified endocrinologist and obesity medicine physician with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ethosendo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethos Endocrinology</a>&nbsp;in Houston.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of Wegovy for weight loss, participants without diabetes who took Wegovy lost, on average, 12.4 percent of their initial body weight compared to those who received a placebo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a clinical trial conducted in people with type 2 diabetes, those who took Wegovy lost 6.2 percent of their body weight compared to those who received a placebo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those who took Wegovy lost weight steadily for 16 months before plateauing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gastrointestinal issues — diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, indigestion, flatulence — were commonly reported side effects. These side effects typically resolved on their own, but 5 percent of participants stopped taking the medication because of them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other participants reported headache, fatigue, and dizziness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes are likely good candidates for the dual benefit of improved blood sugar control and weight loss,” said Kanji.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Kanji, data suggests Wegovy has a favorable safety profile compared to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/prescription-medications-treat-overweight-obesity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">older weight loss medicationsTrusted Source</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a><strong>Here’s who shouldn’t take Wegovy</strong></a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wegovy should not be used with other drugs used for weight loss or medications that contain semaglutide, according to the FDA.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wegovy has a potential risk of thyroid C-cell tumors and should also not be given to people with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma and Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The drug has not been studied in people who have a history of pancreatitis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The drug, at a dose of 1 mg, was first approved for type 2 diabetes in 2017.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kanji plans to add Wegovy as a treatment option for certain patients with obesity — especially those with type 2 diabetes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/novo-nordisk-s-wegovy-weight-loss-injection-gets-fda-approval" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The price</a>&nbsp;is expected to be similar to Saxenda, which costs $1,349 a month without insurance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“As is often the case, cost and health insurance coverage will be the limiting factor,” said Kanji.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a><strong>The bottom line</strong></a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved the diabetes drug semaglutide to be used as a weight-loss medication in patients with obesity. The drug is a synthetic version of a gut hormone that suppresses hunger and appetite. In clinical trials, participants who took the medication lost about 12 percent of their body weight compared to those who took a placebo. This is the first drug the FDA has approved for weight loss since 2014.</p>

<ul><li><strong>An experimental weight loss drug is making headlines after people lost over 20% of their body weight in trials.</strong></li><li><strong>The drug has not yet been approved by the FDA.</strong></li><li><strong>Experts say the findings are interesting but it likely will not be a silver bullet to end obesity.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Participants in a clinical trial lost over 50 pounds on average when they were treated with the highest dose of a new hunger suppressant,&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-tirzepatide-delivered-225-weight-loss-adults-obesity-or" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according</a>&nbsp;to the drugmaker Eli Lilly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the drug called tirzepatide has made headlines, it is important to note that it is still experimental and has not been approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration. Additionally, the initial research has been made public by the drug maker Eli Lilly and has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While it is still early, some medical experts say that new treatments are needed to treat obesity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Obesity is a chronic disease that often does not receive the same standard of care as other conditions, despite its impact on physical, psychological and metabolic health, which can include increased risk of hypertension, heart disease, cancer and decreased survival,” study investigator Louis J. Aronne, MD, of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, said in a&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-tirzepatide-delivered-225-weight-loss-adults-obesity-or" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What the study found</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 72-week, phase III&nbsp;<a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04184622?term=surmount-1&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SURMOUNT-1 clinical trial&nbsp;</a>found that people taking 15 mg of a once-weekly injectable drug called tirzepatide lost 22.5 percent of their body weight – for an average weight loss among participants of 52 pounds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Eli Lilly, the trial was a double-blind, placebo study run at multiple centers with 2,539 participants. The researchers compared the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in varying doses to a placebo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The drug combines synthetic mimics of two hormones called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6812410/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GLP-1Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/gastric-inhibitory-polypeptide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GIP</a>&nbsp;that our bodies naturally release after a meal to make us feel full.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trial participants, who weighed 230 pounds on average at trial start, self-injected tirzepatide once per week at varying doses or a placebo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The people participating in the study had obesity and had at least one comorbidity including high blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnea, or cardiovascular disease. No one had type 2 diabetes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity were followed by all participants during the 72-week study period.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Findings indicate that the highest dose was most effective, resulting in an average weight loss of more than 50 pounds, an average weight reduction of nearly 23 percent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, participants injecting the placebo only lost about five pounds on average, even though they also cut calories and increased exercise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Commonly reported adverse events included nausea, constipation, and diarrhea. They were generally mild to moderate in severity, and typically occurred when the dose was increased.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Tirzepatide data looks impressive and highlights a new class of highly effective medications to treat obesity,” said Dr.&nbsp;<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/23060-w-scott-butsch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">W. Scott Butsch</a>, MD, Director of Obesity Medicine in the Bariatric and Metabolic Institute at Cleveland Clinic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Butsch added that it’s the first drug to produce an average of 20 percent weight loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Which is twice as much as the current obesity medications outside this class,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“To have a highly effective medical treatment is an important step in treating the disease of obesity and helping our patients who commonly think that if a lifestyle change doesn’t work then bariatric surgery is the only option,” continued Butsch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Obesity is a chronic condition</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While this drug has made headlines for its initial findings,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ucihealth.org/find-a-doctor/d/jeffrey-g-dyo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeffrey G. Dyo</a>, MD, Internal Medicine at UCI Health in Irvine, California, said that it will likely not be a simple solution for people looking to keep the weight off permanently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dyo believes that people taking tirzepatide might have to continue using the drug to maintain their weight loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Obesity is considered a chronic medical disease and may persist or relapse for months to years in duration,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, he pointed out that studies with similar weight loss medications suggest ceasing use may lead to regaining the lost weight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The duration of therapy indefinitely or long term has not specifically been studied yet in tirzepatide,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dyo noted it’s possible that certain individuals could keep the weight off once they’ve achieved their goal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Weight loss often doesn’t last long term</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://med.uc.edu/depart/intmed/divisions/diabetes/directory/entire-directory/Index/Pubs/sbpatel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shailendra Patel</a>, MD, PhD, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, told Healthline that approaches to weight loss have typically involved dieting but that diets often result only in short term weight loss because they are extremely difficult to stick with for an indefinite period of time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The reason that all these diets fail is that human beings cannot stick with any one of these diet plans forever,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reasons for obesity and why it is difficult to lose weight are complex. Certain hormones or health conditions can lead to weight gain in addition to a lack of healthy food options.&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21117971/#:~:text=Abstract,in%20energy%20intake%20and%20expenditure." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">StudiesTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;have found that the human body often reverts to a “set point” for weight, so if a person has obesity, it can become extremely difficult to lose weight even with diet and exercise. There are people with obesity, who have a healthy diet and active lifestyle just as there are people with moderate weight who have an unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Patel points out that due to the complexity of obesity relying on a single solution, whether a diet or a pill, is likely not going to work long term.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have yet another weight loss drug to help patients, said Patel. “But drugs by themselves, just like crash diets by themselves, you can see weight loss – but you won’t be successful.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said if people with obesity want to lose weight it may require multiple interventions some of which may include medical interventions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Patel pointed out that even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/bariatric-surgery/types" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bariatric surgeryTrusted Source</a>, which involves shrinking or bypassing the stomach through surgery, requires patients to change their long-term approach to diet and exercise for the best results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>The bottom line</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recent clinical trial results show once weekly, injectable drug tirzepatide may help people lose significant amounts of weight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It has not yet been approved by the FDA and the data has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Experts say that obesity is a chronic condition with underlying biological processes and that it’s possible people will need to stay on the drug long term to keep the weight off. They also say that regardless of method used, successful, long-term weight loss may include both drugs and lifestyle changes.</p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overview</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Scandinavia, saunas have long been used as a way to socialize as well as for their many health benefits. And while they aren’t quite as popular in the United States, you can still find saunas in many gyms and community centers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Saunas are a nice way to relax and have a good sweat, but can they really help you lose weight? The short answer is…&nbsp;<em>sort of</em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Researchers still have a lot to learn about how the heat from saunas affects the body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>How different types of saunas work</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A sauna is defined as a room that’s heated to temperatures between 150ºF and 195ºF (65.6ºC and 90.6ºC). Finnish-style saunas are considered “dry,” while Turkish style saunas have lots of steam. People typically spend around 15 to 30 minutes in a sauna.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While the temperatures and humidity levels vary, saunas generally work the same when it comes to how your body reacts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are the most common types of saunas:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Wood burning</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wood-burning stoves are used to heat sauna rocks. Temperatures are high and humidity is low.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Electrically heated sauna</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An electric heater mounted on the floor or wall is used to heat the room. Temperatures are high and humidity is low.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Steam rooms</h3>

<h2><a>Can you sweat off weight?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a tiny bit of weight loss happening while you’re in the sauna. That’s because you’re sweating off water weight. Once you begin drinking again, the water weight returns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The higher temperatures cause your heart rate to increase in a way similar to exercise. But this increase only causes a slightly higher calorie burn than sitting at rest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sauna may be able to help you burn some extra calories, but don’t bank on sweat sessions alone to shed pounds. It isn’t an effective tool for real weight loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Dangers of dehydration</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Extreme heat makes your body sweat. When you sweat, you lose fluids. If you lose more fluid than what you’re taking in, you can become dehydrated. There is a risk of getting dehydrated from being in a sauna.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/press_releases/sauna_health_benefits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harvard Medical School</a>, the average person loses about 1 pint of fluid during a short time in the sauna. However, if you drink enough water before, during, and after your time in the sauna, you will replace fluids lost by sweating.</p>

<h3>Signs of dehydration</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Severe dehydration is a medical emergency. It’s important to pay attention to your body and drink plenty of fluids if you use a sauna.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be aware of these signs of mild to moderate dehydration:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>dryness in the mouth</li><li>extreme thirst</li><li>headache</li><li>feeling dizzy or lightheaded</li><li>not urinating as frequently as normal</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Older adults and people with chronic conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, and heart failure, or those who are pregnant, are at a higher risk of becoming dehydrated.</p>

<h2><a>Saunas and heart health</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The high heat levels you experience in a sauna cause your blood vessels to open up and move closer to the skin’s surface. When blood vessels expand, your circulation improves, and your blood pressure gets lower.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(18)30275-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent studies</a>&nbsp;have found links between regular sauna use and improved heart health. However, people who have heart issues, such as an irregular heartbeat or recent heart attack, are usually told to avoid saunas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People with high blood pressure can use saunas, but the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/getting-active-to-control-high-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Heart Association (AHA)Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;warns against moving between extreme hot and cold temperatures because it can raise your blood pressure. Also, those on heart medications should check with their healthcare provider before using a sauna.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>The takeaway</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Studies from Finland, Japan, and Germany have found health benefits to regular sauna use. For healthy adults, sitting in a sauna at temperatures around 190ºF (87.8ºC) is considered safe. If you’re pregnant or have a chronic health condition, you’ll want to consult your doctor first.</p>
