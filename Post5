<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New research found that caffeine doesn’t appear to impact the success of fertility treatments, however, regular alcohol consumption can reduce people’s chances of getting pregnant and having a live birth after these treatments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The meta-analysis, which published in&nbsp;<a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aogs.14464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica ScandinavicaTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;Wednesday, also found that men’s alcohol consumption can impact the risk of a pregnant partner experiencing a miscarriage after a fertility treatment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though scientists are still learning about the ways in which alcohol and caffeine impact fertility, it’s widely believed that alcohol can cause hormonal imbalances, alter the health of the uterus, and impair sperm quality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://danaellishunnes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dana Ellis Hunnes</a>, a clinical dietitian, assistant professor at UCLA Fielding school of public health, and author of&nbsp;<a href="https://tinyurl.com/5csp7bbm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recipe for Survival</a>, says the main takeaway is that alcohol consumption, even in low or moderate amounts, in both men and women is associated with decreased fertility when pursuing in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Keeping this in mind might encourage more people to abstain from alcohol if they are trying to get pregnant through one of these methods,” Hunnes said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a><strong>Alcohol linked to lower pregnancy and birth rates</strong></a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The researchers evaluated 16 studies that included a total of 26,922 women and their partners who underwent IVF or ICSI.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The research team analyzed data on seven studies that looked at caffeine and alcohol consumption among people who underwent fertility treatments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They found that caffeine didn’t appear to impact the woman’s ability to get pregnant or successfully give birth after fertility treatments, however, those who drank 84 grams, which equates to about seven drinks, a week experienced a 7% lower chance of getting pregnant compared to those who didn’t drink alcohol.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Interestingly, the male partner’s alcohol consumption also impacted the pregnancy success rates after fertility treatments. When the men drank 84 grams of alcohol a week, the live birth rate decreased by 9%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“In summary, when the woman consumes alcohol, there is a decreased chance of achieving pregnancy. When the male partner consumes alcohol, there is an increased risk of miscarriage,” says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.littlelifenutrition.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Becca Romero</a>, a clinical nutritionist, fertility specialist and owner of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.littlelifenutrition.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Life Nutrition</a>.</p>

<h2><a><strong>Does caffeine affect pregnancy?</strong></a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Women are often advised to avoid caffeine during pregnancy, however, caffeine — especially in low doses — is less toxic than alcohol, says Hunnes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Romero was surprised to see that this meta-analysis found that caffeine didn’t have a significant impact for women during fertility treatment since other previous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2010/08/moderate-caffeine-consumption-during-pregnancy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a>&nbsp;have found inconclusive results for caffeine consumption to miscarriage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a><strong>Here’s how alcohol impacts pregnancy</strong></a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr. Brindha Bavan, a reproductive medicine and fertility specialist at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/service/fertility-and-reproductive-health/careteam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stanford Medicine Children’s Health</a>, says that alcohol can cause hormonal imbalances that can interfere with an embryo’s ability to implant to the uterus wall. Alcohol can also cause&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3527168/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oxidative stressTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;throughout the body and impact egg quality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“When going through IVF, it is imperative that eggs are of high quality so they are healthy enough to be transferred for a viable pregnancy,” Romero said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the study showed, the male’s drinking, which is often overlooked, can also affect a pregnancy after fertility treatments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Bavan, past&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917074/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">researchTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;has shown that heavy alcohol use has been associated with erectile dysfunction and lower&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5504800/#:~:text=Effects%20of%20alcohol%20on%20male,and%20sperm%20production%20%5B48%5D." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sperm qualityTrusted Source</a>. Alcohol may also cause genetic changes in the sperm, Bavan added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Alcohol consumption can cause&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110569014000661#:~:text=Acute%20and%20chronic%20administration%20of,pituitary%20gland%20and%20the%20hypothalamus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oxidative stress</a>&nbsp;in the body and therefore have a negative impact on sperm quality and how morphologically normal the sperm are,” Romero said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a><strong>What to know about drinking during fertility treatments&nbsp;</strong></a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Romero says that she advises people undergoing fertility treatments to behave as though they are already pregnant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It is clear that alcohol can have a negative impact on the ability to achieve pregnancy and it is not worth the risk for a few drinks,” Romero said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hunnes says that, based on these new findings, there doesn’t seem to be a need to avoid caffeine altogether, however, she would still recommend limiting caffeine consumption to one to two cups a day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to limiting alcohol and caffeine consumption, eating a healthy diet and taking a high-quality prenatal vitamin can boost one’s chances at getting pregnant through IVF.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Overall, moderation is key to optimize general health and well-being before pregnancy,” Bavan said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a><strong>The bottom line:</strong>&nbsp;</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>New research found that caffeine doesn’t appear to impact the success of fertility treatments, however, regular alcohol consumption can reduce people’s chances of getting pregnant and having a live birth. scientists are still learning about the ways in which alcohol and caffeine impact fertility, but it’s widely believed that alcohol can cause hormonal imbalances, alter the health of the uterus, and impair sperm quality.</p>

<ul><li><strong>CVS is reducing the price of store-brand period products and will pay the sales tax in 13 states, according to a statement from the company.</strong></li><li><strong>Healthcare providers and advocates welcome the move as a step toward period justice.</strong></li><li><strong>People who menstruate have been grappling with rising costs, and people were challenged financially to afford them because of income loss during the pandemic. For them, CVS’ announcement may feel like a rare act of relief.</strong></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seems like it’s impossible to watch the news these days without hearing about inflation, shortage, and shortage-induced inflation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But last week, people who menstruate got a rare piece of good news.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cvshealth.com/womens-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CVS announced</a>&nbsp;it would lower prices on CVS Health and Live Better tampons, menstrual pads, liners, and cups on Oct. 13.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CVS is also now paying the sales taxes on menstrual products in 12 states: Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CVS cannot assume the taxes in other states that charge them because of laws that do not allow third-parties to take care of the tax for customers. One physician applauded the decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Another step toward acknowledging how vital these products are to people who menstruate,” says Dr.&nbsp;<a href="https://drcurrywinchell.com/meet-dr-bcw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bayo Curry-Winchell</a>, a physician, TEDx speaker, and founder of Beyond Clinical Walls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Curry-Winchell and other providers and advocates discussed the significance of CVS’ announcement and the importance of addressing period poverty, particularly in a world struggling to recover from the economic strains brought on by the pandemic and mounting inflation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What is the pink tax?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What’s more essential: Donuts, tattoos, bingo game supplies, or menstrual products?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.unicef.org/wash/menstrual-hygiene" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">For the 1.8 billion people</a>&nbsp;worldwide who menstruate each month, the answer is probably period products.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And yet,&nbsp;<a href="https://revenue.ky.gov/News/Publications/Sales%20Tax%20Newsletters/Sales%20Tax%20Facts%202019%20-%20Dec.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kentucky</a>&nbsp;doesn’t tax donuts,&nbsp;<a href="https://dor.mo.gov/taxation/business/tax-types/sales-use/exemption-list.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bingo supplies</a>&nbsp;are tax-exempt in Missouri, and people getting tattoos do not incur a&nbsp;<a href="https://dor.georgia.gov/taxes/business-taxes/sales-use-tax/what-subject-sales-and-use-tax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sales tax in Georgia</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kentucky, Missouri, and Georgia are three of the 22 states in the U.S.that charge a sales tax for menstrual products, also known as a pink tax,&nbsp;<a href="https://allianceforperiodsupplies.org/tampon-tax/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Alliance for Period Supplies</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Twenty-two other states, including New York, California, Maryland, Colorado, and the District of Columbia, exempt period products from taxes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alaska, Montana, Delaware, New Hampshire, and Oregon do not have a state sales tax. But cities and counties may impose their own taxes. The Alliance for Period Supplies says sales taxes on period products are usually 4 to 5%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Usually, essential items, like most food and medication, are tax-exempt. Dr. Padmini Murthy, the global health lead for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amwa-doc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Medical Women’s Association</a>, says it’s long past time period products made this list nationwide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Menstrual inequity affects menstruators in the U.S. and contributes to missed school or workdays and impacts on mental well-being and self-confidence,” Murthy says.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>The impact of inflation on period products</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://swnsdigital.com/us/2019/11/new-research-reveals-how-much-the-average-woman-spends-per-month-on-menstrual-products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A 2019 survey</a>&nbsp;of 2,000 women indicated that women paid $13.25 per month for menstrual supplies. Therefore, the authors estimated that the average person who menstruates would spend about $6,360 during their reproductive lifetime (12-52 years old).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was three years ago. Since then, there are two things menstrual products have not been exempt from: Inflation and supply-chain issues.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2022/the-numbers-behind-the-feminine-product-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NielsenIQ data</a>&nbsp;released in June of 2022 indicated that the price of tampons rose by 9.8%, while the cost of pads increased by 8.3% from January to May. The same report also called attention to a shortage of period products, pointing to supply chain issues, increased costs of materials, and labor shortages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Contributing factors may include interruptions in the supply chain and increased costs of raw materials used in making menstrual products, including cotton, rayon, and plastic,” Murthy says.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the consumer quite literally paid the price.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Inflation is hitting people in the wallets,” says Dr. Sophia Yen, MD, MPH, the co-founder and CEO of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pandiahealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pandia Health</a>. “Women shouldn’t have to choose between menstrual hygiene products and food, rent, and medications.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Murthy hopes that CVS’ move reduces — and, better yet, eliminates — the number of menstruating people who have to make these decisions between which essential items to purchase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“By reducing the cost of CVS menstrual products and covering the tampon tax on other products, when possible, CVS is taking bold, strong steps in addressing period poverty,” Murthy says. ”Given the presence of CVS across the country, the impact on those who will be buying menstrual products is significant.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though CVS will cover the “pink tax” on all items, Yen does note that only CVS period product prices will be reduced. Though she wishes the move went further, she does think CVS is operating in good faith.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“CVS can control how much profit it makes on its products,” Murthy says. “It can’t control how much others charge.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Murthy agrees and hopes it has a ripple effect that inspires other brands stocked by CVS to take a similar measure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“This move by CVS may pave the way for other menstrual product manufacturers to do the same and bring much-needed media attention to this important public health issue,” Murthy says.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Period poverty, the pandemic, and beyond</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While CVS’ move will provide relief for anyone needing period products, healthcare providers and advocates particularly highlight its potential effect on historically marginalized and underserved communities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Research around&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/period-poverty-was-a-health-crisis-before-the-pandemic-now-its-worse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">period poverty</a>&nbsp;is limited but growing.&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/2019/02000/Unmet_Menstrual_Hygiene_Needs_Among_Low_Income.2.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A 2019 study</a>&nbsp;of low-income women in St. Louis, Missouri suggested that two-thirds of respondents could not afford menstrual products at some point during the previous year. More than 1 in 5 people (21%) experienced this hardship monthly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>About 13 months after that study was published, the pandemic hit, and period poverty grew.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research published in 2021</a>&nbsp;surveyed 1,496 menstruating people from March to October 2020. Authors indicated that pandemic-related income loss was a strong predictor of menstrual product insecurity, especially among people from lower-income communities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Many people were faced with a reduction or loss of income that left little to no money to purchase food, female products, or medications,” Curry-Winchell says. “The resources that helped provide a lifeline to access menstrual products such as schools, churches, and resource centers like food banks were shut down or out of stock.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And yet, at least anecdotally, period poverty didn’t get as much attention as food insecurity and the plight of businesses forced to close during the pandemic. Why is that?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The answer is bias and stigma and the lack of attention by many to issues that affect mostly women and girls,” Murthy says. “Discussion about menstruation is often considered taboo, with both men and women feeling embarrassed to talk about it. It is important to understand that menstruation is a natural biological process and a normal phenomenon.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A natural, biological occurrence that requires special hygiene products. When these products are lacking or unaffordable, Murthy says it harms people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Women either miss engaging in critical activities, or they are forced to use inconvenient and sometimes less healthy unsanitary alternatives,” she says. “Period poverty can affect an individual’s education, income, health, emotional well-being, and standing in the community.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Murthy is realistic. She knows CVS’ move won’t wipe out period inequality in one big swoop. But she hopes it has a domino effect toward putting period products on the same level as food and medication (and donuts and tattoos).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“To support and protect individuals from undue burden, taxes on menstrual products should be eliminated, the cost of menstrual products should be factored into social welfare programs, such as food stamps and Medicaid, and — like toilet paper and soap — menstrual products should be provided free in schools, places of work, and other public spaces,” Murthy says.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
